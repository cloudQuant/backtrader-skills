# Review rules

Validation layers are specification, Python AST, current-fork API, security/path/dependency,
import/collection, smoke, runonce/runnext, target tests, baseline, and artifact integrity.

Static review never imports candidate code. P0 execution accepts only product-generated candidates.
Unknown third-party candidates may be reviewed with `--allow-third-party`, but cannot obtain a run
approval. Stable `SEC_*` codes identify trust-boundary failures; `BT_*` codes identify fork API,
construction, or look-ahead failures.

Repair changes typed IR or re-renders it. It does not use textual `exec`, `eval`, `compile`, dynamic
imports, or guessed source edits.

## Coverage boundaries

The AST and import gate is defense-in-depth on top of the hash-bound execution path, not an
operating-system sandbox. It statically rejects forbidden imports, dynamic execution, command
execution, live stores, absolute paths, positive-constant line indices, and a denylist of dunder
escape primitives (`__subclasses__`, `__bases__`, `__mro__`, `__globals__`, `__builtins__`,
`__code__`). It does not restrict `getattr`/`setattr` (the generated evaluator uses `getattr`) or
attribute access in general, and it does not statically catch positive indices produced by computed
expressions or variables. Candidate execution is therefore additionally gated by a separately
approved, hash-bound run token that only accepts unchanged artifacts from an approved render/apply.
