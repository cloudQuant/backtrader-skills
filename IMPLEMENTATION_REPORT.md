# Iteration 17 P0 implementation report

## Delivered

- One independently installable Python distribution and unified CLI under
  `src/backtrader_skills/`.
- Three canonical skills: author, review, and test. Their scripts only forward to the unified
  runtime.
- Seven named JSON Schemas, with `DataSpec` defined at
  `dataset-manifest-v1.schema.json#/$defs/DataSpec`, plus the shared
  `comparison-profile-v1.json`.
- Full offline metadata catalog: 1,152 functional tests, 1,035 strategy packages, 1,032 mapped
  identities, and 1,155 union entries.
- Opaque read-only roots, CSV inspection, deterministic normalization, content-addressed dataset
  objects, full semantic-hash dataset IDs, immutable manifests, bounded preview, quality gates, and
  multi-feed overlap validation.
- Canonical StrategySpec input/output with compatibility aliases and restricted
  Expression/Action/StateRule IR.
- Seven archetypes and both `single_test` and `python_bundle` renderers from the same IR.
- AST/security validation with fork-aware direct Strategy, cooperative parent, and framework
  component initialization rules.
- Generated candidates can import only top-level `backtrader`; controller-package, filesystem,
  process, and network imports are rejected. Execution additionally proves candidate bytes came
  from an approved deterministic render/apply.
- Separate hash-bound write and execution approvals use 256-bit capabilities, digest-only
  persistence, TTL, explicit approval, and terminal `CONSUMED/REVOKED/EXPIRED` states.
- Multi-file artifact apply preflights and stages all bytes, records a journal, and rolls back
  already committed targets if a later target write fails.
- Fixed active-environment `python -I` child execution for runonce and runnext; under the required
  Anaconda base invocation this resolves to that environment's interpreter, and the controller
  never imports candidate code.
- Backtrader provenance is constrained to `cloudQuant/backtrader`: doctor verifies the active
  interpreter without importing the package, installs the cloudQuant Git source only when the
  module is missing, warns rather than replaces an existing unverifiable package, and execution,
  source helpers, and acceptance reject targets from other forks.
- The 11 standard metrics, explicit units/nullability, frozen comparison tolerances, normalized
  event comparison, JSON/Markdown reports, and typed-IR repair/re-render.
- Manifest-driven preview/apply and protected uninstall for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and
  OpenClaw native skill directories.

## Shared-contract migration

The implementation originally used a truncated `ds_<24hex>` ID during local construction. Before
release it was migrated to canonical `ds_<64hex semantic hash>`. StrategySpec output now always uses
the shared top-level fields (`feeds`, `entry`, `exit`, `sizing`, `risk`) and carries the restricted
IR under `ir`. Dataset, corpus, artifact, validation, run-manifest, and run-result exports include
the agreed shared core fields; Skills-specific evidence is additive.

This is a pre-release migration. There are no published old IDs to preserve. Any local exploratory
runtime made before the migration must re-register its dataset and regenerate its draft; old
truncated IDs are intentionally rejected rather than guessed.

## Acceptance evidence

Commands use `/Users/yunjinqi/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n base`.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| cloudQuant Backtrader provenance | URL, Git checkout, missing-install, existing-package warning, target rejection, doctor output, and run warning are covered; current doctor verifies the local cloudQuant checkout |
| Iteration 17 product pytest suite | 25 passed (historical baseline) |
| Black (source and tests) | Pass |
| Ruff | All checks passed |
| Catalog snapshot count/hash check | Pass |
| Wheel content check for schemas, policy, snapshot, adapters, skills | Pass |
| Built-wheel clean-install acceptance | Pass; source checkout absent from `sys.path` |
| MCP/Agent sibling absence in isolated install/repository | Pass |
| 7 archetypes × 2 profiles acceptance | 14/14 pass; `evidence/acceptance-7x2.json` |
| Acceptance data profiles | Seven distinct manifests; all six adapters; real multi-feed/resample/custom-line cases |
| Structured repair gate | Multi-data, multi-timeframe, and ML failure → repair → revalidation → dual-mode run pass |
| Every acceptance cell runonce/runnext metric parity | Pass |
| Every acceptance cell normalized event parity | Pass |
| Clean fixture with no sibling MCP/Agent import | Pass |

The acceptance evidence records per-cell data provenance, mode hashes, comparison hashes, repair
diagnostics, built-wheel data, and clean-install runtime dependency provenance. It is included in
the distribution manifest and packaged wheel. The Iteration 17 count above is historical context;
the current exact release result is the refreshed
`evidence/acceptance-7x2.json`, generated through `scripts/run_acceptance.py` during release
acceptance. Repository maintainers run these commands through the Anaconda `base` environment,
while public installation and usage commands remain environment-agnostic.

The repository-wide `make test-fast` result recorded before this focused Skills acceptance change
was `2,474 passed, 1 skipped`. It is historical integration evidence, not silently presented as a
fresh result of the current product-only verification.

## Honest P0 limits

- Child-process isolation plus AST/path/import gates is not a complete OS sandbox. There is no
  container, network namespace, seccomp, or cgroup.
- Pandas adapters accept safely materialized tabular CSV; pickle, arbitrary DataFrame constructors,
  and user callables are rejected.
- The catalog snapshot is complete metadata with deterministic lexical search. It does not bundle
  all corpus source or provide embedding search.
- Repair is deterministic IR revision/re-render. It does not guess a semantic strategy fix or patch
  arbitrary third-party source.
- The automated runner proves local runonce/runnext parity. A master/dev financial baseline still
  requires an isolated checkout and human-approved expected values.
- JSON and Markdown reports are implemented. HTML rendering and container execution remain P1.
- Tests verify four native host layouts and skill metadata; actual client UI discovery needs the
  corresponding host binary and is not simulated.
